        ceil	    Calculates the number which is equal to the integer just greater than the number passed
        floor	    Calculates the number which is equal to the integer just smaller than the number passed
        fmin	    Returns the smaller number among the 2 numbers passed to it
        fmax	    Returns the larger number among the 2 numbers passed to it
        fabs	    Calculates the absolute value of a number
        round	    Rounds a float or a double to the nearest integer
        sqrt	    Calculates the square root of a number
        pow	        It takes two numbers as parameters and returns the value of the first number raised to the power equal to the second number
        log	        Returns the logarithm of a number.
